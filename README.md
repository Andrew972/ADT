This project draws inspiration from the traditional ADT home security service and implemets a security and emergency response system for home owners or renters. Depending on the size of the client house, there are 3 packages that can be purchased each suitable for a unique house plan. 

Clients can interact with the system through a GUI which displays statistics about the condition and safety of their house as meassured by the sensors placed around their houses. To protect the privacy of each user and keep their resident information secure, certain features of the GUI is password protected.
